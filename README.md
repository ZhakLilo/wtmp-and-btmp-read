# wtmp-and-btmp-read
Perl script that is used to read the wtmp and btmp logs located in the /var/log folder.

The script needs to be chown'ed to 755
The script is executed like this:

./script_name.pl wtmp <br>
./script_name.pl btmp

The script is not mine, first I saw it here: https://askubuntu.com/a/1447635 and the user shared that the actual source is: https://www.hcidata.info/wtmp.htm

Enjoy!
